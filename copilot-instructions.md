## Code Style for MUI Components

- Use `styled` from `@mui/material/styles` for reusable components.
- Use object style syntax, not template literals.
- Use the `sx` prop for per-instance and responsive customizations.
- Avoid legacy JSS and global CSS.

Apply these conventions in all MUI-related suggestions.
